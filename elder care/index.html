          </h2>
          <p>
            Helps improve posture, balance, and body awareness.
            Standing strong, steady, and centered in Mountain Pose helps to improve posture, alignment, and balance. This can benefit other yoga poses as well as your daily movements.

            Vrikshasana (Tree Pose):
          </h2>
            <p>
              Enhances balance, stability, and concentration.
              Anyone can practice Vrikshsana who does not have migraine, insomnia, dizziness, knee or ankle pain and low or high blood pressure. Practicing Vrikshasana involves the entire leg from foot to hip. Hence, it makes your legs strong and stable. It improves your body balance.
              Vrikshasana calms and relaxes the central nervous system and stretches the entire body.
               It strengthens the legs and opens the hips and improves your neuromuscular coordination and endurance. It may thus be helpful for those who suffer from sciatica (nerve pain in the leg).

              Helps in relaxation, reduces stress, and promotes better sleep.

            Pranayama (Breathing exercises)
          </h2>
            <p>
              Deep breathing techniques like Dirga Pranayama or Nadi Shodhana can help improve lung capacity, reduce stress, and promote a sense of calm.
              Daily pranayama trains the lungs and improves the capacity of respiratory system immensely. Pranayama directly works on the nervous system. Daily Pranayama positively affects autonomic nervous system which controls and governs essential functions of the body like the heart rate, respiration and blood pressure etc.
