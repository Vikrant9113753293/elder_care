    <p>Proper medication usage and storage are crucial for ensuring your safety and maintaining the effectiveness of your medications. Here are some best practices to follow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Read Medication Labels:</strong> Carefully read and follow the instructions on medication labels, including dosage, frequency, and any special instructions.</li>
      <li><strong>Use the Right Dosage:</strong> Never take more or less than the prescribed dosage. If you have any questions or concerns, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist.</li>
      <li><strong>Store Medications Properly:</strong> Keep medications in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight, moisture, and heat. Some medications may need to be stored in the refrigerator.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep Medications Secure:</strong> Store medications out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidental ingestion. Consider using child-resistant containers.</li>
      <li><strong>Dispose of Expired Medications:</strong> Check the expiration dates of your medications regularly and safely dispose of any expired or unused medications. Do not flush medications down the toilet unless specifically instructed to do so.</li>
      <li><strong>Keep Track of Medications:</strong> Maintain a list of all the medications you are taking, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, and supplements. Update the list regularly and share it with your healthcare provider.</li>
      <li><strong>Consult Your Healthcare Provider:</strong> If you have any questions or concerns about your medications, side effects, or interactions, consult your healthcare provider or pharmacist.</li>
    </ul>
